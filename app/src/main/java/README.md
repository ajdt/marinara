== NOTE ==
* Timer could have been implemented with Android widget Chronometer. I did not do this b/c I
wanted to stick with API level 15 for th project. This may change in the future.

== Future Changes/Features ==
* [ ] switch from java.util.Date libraries to joda time libraries
* [ ] add notifications feature when timer expires
* [ ] create lock screen activity. displays time remaining (no interactivity)
